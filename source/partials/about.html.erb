        <p>Hello, I'm Patrik, a brazillian Full-stack Developer based in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>
          Building apps and coming up with creative solutions has become a great
          passion that I discovered along with programming. After taking Le Wagon's
          coding bootcamp in 2022, my software developer journey started, and since
          then I never stopped learning and growing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy all the processes of creating a web application, from product
          design to coding and hosting. I am constantly trying new stacks and
          experimenting with new stuff, if you have suggestions feel free to reach out!
