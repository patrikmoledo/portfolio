    <p>Hello, I'm Patrik, a brazillian Full-stack Developer based in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>
      Building apps and coming up with creative solutions has become a great
      passion that I discovered along with programming. After taking Le Wagon's
      coding bootcamp in 2022, my software developer journey started, and since
      then I never stopped learning and growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy all the processes of creating a web application, from product
      design to coding and hosting. I am constantly trying new stacks and
      experimenting with new stuff, if you have suggestions feel free to reach out!
